ðŸ”¸ 1. Recap of Session 5
â€¢ CSS Display property â€“ block, inline, inline-block, none
â€¢ Visibility property â€“ visible vs hidden
â€¢ Overflow control â€“ visible, hidden, scroll, auto
â€¢ Positioning â€“ static, relative, absolute, fixed
â€¢ z-index, top, bottom, left, right for placement
â€¢ Practice layout: fixed navbar, background banner, floating box, scrollable section

ðŸ”¸ 2. Introduction to Flexbox

Concepts to Cover:
â€¢ What is Flexbox and why it's useful
â€¢ One-dimensional layout model (works in rows or columns)
â€¢ Helps align, space, and distribute items efficiently
â€¢ Simplifies layout creation compared to float or inline-block

Visual Explanation:
â€¢ Main axis vs cross axis
â€¢ Horizontal and vertical alignment with ease
â€¢ Common layout problems solved by Flexbox

ðŸ”¸ 3. Flex Container Properties

Concepts to Cover:
â€¢ display: flex â€“ enables Flexbox on a container
â€¢ flex-direction â€“ row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse
â€¢ flex-wrap â€“ nowrap (default), wrap, wrap-reverse
â€¢ justify-content â€“ align items along main axis (start, end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly)
â€¢ align-items â€“ align items on cross axis (start, end, center, stretch, baseline)
â€¢ align-content â€“ controls multiple lines when wrapping is used

Practice Idea:
â€¢ Create a navigation bar with evenly spaced links using justify-content
â€¢ Practice flex-direction to make vertical vs horizontal boxes

ðŸ”¸ 4. Flex Item Properties

Concepts to Cover:
â€¢ order â€“ change item order without HTML changes
â€¢ flex-grow â€“ how much space an item should take when extra space is available
â€¢ flex-shrink â€“ how much an item should shrink when needed
â€¢ flex-basis â€“ default size before remaining space is distributed
â€¢ align-self â€“ override align-items on individual items

Demo Idea:
â€¢ Create 3 boxes in a row â€“ use grow, shrink, and basis to control their size
â€¢ Make one box grow double the space of others

ðŸ”¸ 5. Practice Activity

Task: Build a Flexbox layout
â€¢ A header with space-between logo and menu
â€¢ A 3-column section that stacks vertically on smaller screens
â€¢ Use align-items to center vertically
â€¢ Use justify-content to create equal spacing

Bonus:
â€¢ Add flex-wrap and test how elements flow


ðŸ”¸ 6. Wrap-up + Q&A

Summary:
â€¢ Learned the core concepts of Flexbox layout
â€¢ Understood flex container vs item properties
