🔸 1. Recap of Session 13
• Reviewed CSS variables (custom properties) for reusable styles.
• Learned how variables improve consistency and simplify theme management.
• Practiced modern CSS features like clamp(), min(), max(), aspect-ratio, and backdrop-filter.
• Built a CSS Variables & Dark Mode Showcase page with responsive typography and frosted glass effects.

🔸 2. Floats in CSS
• Floats were historically used for layouts before Flexbox and Grid.
• Elements float left or right, allowing text or inline content to wrap around.
• Commonly used for images inside text blocks.
• Requires clearfix techniques to handle collapsing container heights.
• Limited compared to modern layout tools but still useful in specific cases.

🔸 3. Shadows in CSS
• Box-shadow — adds depth by creating shadows around elements.
• Text-shadow — applies shadows directly to text for emphasis.
• Shadows can enhance UI design by giving visual hierarchy.
• Multiple shadows can be layered for creative effects.
• Subtle shadows improve readability and user focus.

🔸 4. CSS Filters
• Filters apply graphical effects to elements (blur, brightness, contrast, grayscale, hue-rotate, etc.).
• Often used for images, backgrounds, and hover states.
• backdrop-filter applies effects to content behind an element (frosted glass).
• Can enhance UI aesthetics but may affect performance.

🔸 5. Practical Applications
• Float an image inside a paragraph with text wrapping.
• Apply subtle box-shadow for cards, modals, and buttons.
• Use text-shadow for headings or glowing effects.

🔸 6. Tips & Best Practices
• Avoid using floats for major layouts — prefer Flexbox or Grid.
• Keep shadows subtle — strong shadows can look unnatural.
• Test filters across devices — not all effects render the same.
• Use backdrop-filter sparingly, as it impacts performance.
• Combine shadows and filters with transitions for smooth effects.

🔸 7. Practice Activity
Task: Build a “Shadows & Filters Showcase” page
• Section 1: A paragraph with a floated image.
• Section 2: A card grid with box-shadows.
• Section 3: Text with creative text-shadows.
• Section 4: Image gallery with hover filters.
• Create hover effects with filters like brightness or grayscale.

Bonus Task:
• Create a frosted glass header or card using backdrop-filter.

🔸 8. Wrap-up + Q&A
• Reviewed floats and their role in older layouts.
• Learned how to create depth with box-shadow and text-shadow.
• Practiced using filters and backdrop-filter for UI effects.
• Discussed best practices for performance and design clarity.
