üî∏ 1. Recap of Session 8
‚Ä¢ Understood the concept and importance of responsive design
‚Ä¢ Learned how to use media queries to adapt layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop
‚Ä¢ Practiced using min-width, max-width, and orientation conditions
‚Ä¢ Explored mobile-first vs desktop-first approaches
‚Ä¢ Built a responsive portfolio layout that adjusted navigation and content based on screen size
‚Ä¢ Discussed common pitfalls like overusing breakpoints and fixed units

üî∏ 2. CSS Units & Values

Concepts to Cover:
‚Ä¢ What CSS units are and their role in controlling layout, typography, and spacing
‚Ä¢ Absolute units ‚Äì px, in, cm, mm, pt, pc (fixed measurements that don‚Äôt scale with the viewport)
‚Ä¢ Relative units ‚Äì %, em, rem, vw, vh, vmin, vmax (scale based on parent or viewport size)
‚Ä¢ Understanding the difference between absolute and relative units in responsive design
‚Ä¢ The calc() function ‚Äì combining different units to create dynamic values

Visual Explanation:
‚Ä¢ing based on parent font size vs root font size
‚Ä¢ vw and vh ‚Äì sizing e px vs % for layout width and height
‚Ä¢ em vs rem ‚Äì scallements based on the viewport‚Äôs width and height
‚Ä¢ Using calc() for precise, flexible layouts (e.g., calc(50% - 20px))

üî∏ 3. Practical Applications of Units

Key Points:
‚Ä¢ Use rem for consistent, scalable typography
‚Ä¢ Use % for fluid and flexible layouts
‚Ä¢ Use vw/vh for full-screen sections and responsive hero areas
‚Ä¢ Combine calc() with relative units for precise positioning and spacing
‚Ä¢ Avoid overusing px for responsive designs

Practice Idea:
‚Ä¢ Create a webpage section where:

Headings scale with rem

Paragraphs use em for spacing relative to font size

Layout widths use % for fluid resizing

A hero section is set to 100vh height

A content box width is set using calc(60% - 40px)

üî∏ 4. Tips & Common Mistakes

‚Ä¢ Keep unit usage consistent across your project
‚Ä¢ Test relative units at different zoom levels for accessibility
‚Ä¢ Be aware of em multiplication effect when nested
‚Ä¢ Use rem for global typography for easier scaling

üî∏ 5. Practice Activity

Task: Build a ‚ÄúResponsive Unit Demo‚Äù page
‚Ä¢ Create multiple sections demonstrating px, %, em, rem, vw, vh, and calc()
‚Ä¢ Make a responsive hero section that always fills the screen height
‚Ä¢ Use calc() to evenly distribute space between sidebar and main content

Bonus Task:
‚Ä¢ Combine units with media queries for advanced responsive layouts

üî∏ 6. Wrap-up + Q&A
