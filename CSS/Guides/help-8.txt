🔸 1. Recap of Session 7
• CSS Grid – two-dimensional layout system for rows and columns
• Difference between Flexbox (1D) and Grid (2D)
• Grid container properties – display: grid, grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, gap, repeat(), minmax()
• Grid item placement – grid-column, grid-row, grid-area
• Advanced grid features –  nested grids
• Practice: Built a photo gallery and blog layout with named areas and responsive sizing

🔸 2. Responsive Design Techniques (Media Queries)

Concepts to Cover:
• What is responsive design and why it matters for mobile-first development
• Role of media queries in adapting layouts to different screen sizes
• Breakpoints – common device widths (mobile, tablet, desktop)
• Combining conditions with and, or, not operators
• Mobile-first vs desktop-first approaches

Visual Explanation:
• Syntax of @media rules
• Example: Changing background color, font size, and layout based on screen width
• Testing responsiveness in browser dev tools

🔸 3. Core Media Query Properties

Key Points:
• min-width and max-width conditions
• orientation (portrait, landscape)
• resolution and device pixel ratio
• Targeting specific ranges with combined conditions
• Organizing media queries in CSS for maintainability

Practice Idea:
• Create a responsive webpage with:

Header navigation stacking vertically on mobile, horizontally on desktop

Two-column content collapsing to one column on smaller screens


🔸 4. Tips & Common Mistakes

• Start mobile-first for better performance
• Avoid too many breakpoints – focus on main layout changes
• Always test on multiple devices and browsers

🔸 5. Practice Activity

Task: Build a “Responsive Portfolio” layout
• Desktop: Sidebar on left, main content on right
• Tablet: Sidebar collapses into a top navigation bar
• Mobile: Single-column stacked layout with larger touch-friendly buttons

Bonus Task:
• Add a responsive image gallery that changes number of columns based on screen width

🔸 6. Wrap-up + Q&A

Summary:
• Learned the concept and syntax of media queries
• Understood mobile-first vs desktop-first strategies
• Practiced building layouts that adapt to different devices
• Discussed common pitfalls and best practices for responsive design

🔸 Next Session Preview (Session 9):
• CSS Units & Values – px, %, em, rem, vw, vh, and calc() function
• Understanding relative vs absolute units for flexible design
• Applying units to typography, spacing, and layouts
If you want, I can also prepare Session 9 right away so your flow stays ahead.
Font size and spacing adjustments for readability on different devices
• Use relative units (%, em, rem, vw, vh) instead of fixed px values
