ðŸ”¸ 1. Recap of Session 4
â€¢ CSS Borders â€“ width, style, color, shorthand, and radius
â€¢ Background properties â€“ color, image, repeat, position, size, attachment
â€¢ CSS Box Model â€“ content, padding, border, margin
â€¢ box-sizing â€“ content-box vs border-box
â€¢ Card layout activity using all above properties

ðŸ”¸ 2. CSS Display Property

Concepts to Cover:
â€¢ Purpose of the display property in layout control
â€¢ Common values:

block: takes full width, starts on a new line

inline: flows with content, cannot set width/height cant give margin top and bottom

inline-block: inline flow but allows width/height and also allow margin top and bottom

none: hides the element completely from layout

Extra Tip:
â€¢ Show default display behavior for common elements (div, span, h1, img, etc.)
â€¢ Demonstrate block-to-inline conversion and vice versa

ðŸ”¸ 3. CSS Visibility Property

Concepts to Cover:
â€¢ visibility: visible (default), hidden (element hidden but space reserved)
â€¢ Difference between display: none and visibility: hidden

Use Cases:
â€¢ Temporarily hiding elements

ðŸ”¸ 4. CSS Overflow Property

Concepts to Cover:
â€¢ What happens when content overflows a container
â€¢ overflow: visible (default), hidden, scroll, auto
â€¢ Add scrollbars when content exceeds box size
â€¢ overflow-x and overflow-y for controlling direction

Practice Idea:
â€¢ Create a fixed-size box and test overflow behavior by adding extra text

ðŸ”¸ 5. CSS Positioning

Core Concepts:
â€¢ position: static (default), relative, absolute, fixed
â€¢ relative â€“ shifts from its normal position
â€¢ absolute â€“ positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
â€¢ fixed â€“ stays fixed to viewport during scroll

Other Properties:
â€¢ top, bottom, left, right for placement
â€¢ z-index for stacking elements (brief mention)

Examples:
â€¢ A floating box using absolute
â€¢ Sticky header using fixed
â€¢ Shifting boxes using relative

Visual Demo:
â€¢ Use browser dev tools to experiment with position values
â€¢ Stack elements and highlight how position affects layout

ðŸ”¸ 6. Practice Activity

Task: Create a basic layout with the following:
â€¢ A navigation bar fixed at the top
â€¢ A banner using a background image
â€¢ A floating call-to-action box using absolute positioning
â€¢ A content section with scrollable overflow box
â€¢ A card that uses inline-block layout for multiple boxes

ðŸ”¸ 7. Wrap-up + Q&A

Summary:
â€¢ Learned about how display property changes element behavior
â€¢ Understood visibility vs display
â€¢ Controlled overflowing content with overflow properties
â€¢ Applied different positioning strategies
â€¢ Hands-on layout combining all learned techniques
