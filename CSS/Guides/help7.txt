Concepts to Cover:
â€¢ What is CSS Grid and why itâ€™s powerful for two-dimensional layouts

ðŸ”¸ 3. Setting Up a Grid Container

Core Properties:
â€¢ display: grid â€“ enables grid layout

â€¢ grid-template-rows â€“ define row sizes
â€¢ gap â€“ space between rows and columns (row-gap, column-gap)
â€¢ repeat() function for patterns
â€¢ minmax() for responsive sizing

Practice Idea:
â€¢ Create a 3x3 grid layout with equal spacing
â€¢ Use fractional units (fr) for fluid design

Properties for Grid Items:
â€¢ grid-column â€“ span columns or position in a specific column
