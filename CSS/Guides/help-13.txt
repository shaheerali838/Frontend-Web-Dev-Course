🔸 1. Recap of Session 12
• Reviewed CSS transitions, animations, and transforms.
• Learned the difference between transitions (state changes) and animations (continuous/multi-step).
• Practiced using @keyframes, animation properties, and timing functions.
• Explored 2D and 3D transforms: translate, scale, rotate, skew, rotateX, rotateY, perspective.
• Built hover effects.
• Discussed performance tips — using transforms and opacity for smoother results.

🔸 2. CSS Variables (Custom Properties)
• Allow defining reusable values with a --variable-name format.
• Help maintain consistency across colors, fonts, and spacing.
• Support inheritance — variables in parent elements cascade to children.
• Easily updated for global design changes or theming.

...
• Can be manipulated dynamically with JavaScript for interactivity.

🔸 3. Dark Mode Implementation
• Dark mode enhances readability in low-light environments.
• Achieved by swapping variable values for background, text, and accents.
• Can be applied based on user preference (prefers-color-scheme) or toggle switch.
• Improves accessibility and provides user-friendly UI.
• Relies on CSS variables to efficiently manage multiple themes.

🔸 4. Modern CSS Features
• clamp() — sets min, preferred, and max values for responsive sizing.
• min() / max() — define flexible constraints for layout and typography.
• aspect-ratio — keeps consistent element proportions (useful for images/videos).
• backdrop-filter — applies blur, brightness, or transparency effects behind elements.

🔸 5. Practical Applications
• Create a color system using CSS variables for primary, secondary, and accent colors.
• Implement dark mode by overriding variables.
• Use clamp() to make text responsive.
• Build layouts with aspect-ratio and object-fit for consistent visuals.

🔸 6. Tips & Best Practices
• Use meaningful names (e.g., --primary-color instead of --c1).
• Keep dark mode accessible with proper color contrast.
• Don’t overuse filters/backdrop-filter — they can impact performance.
• Use modern CSS features progressively with fallbacks for older browsers.
• Keep animations subtle when combined with theme switching.

🔸 7. Practice Activity
Task: Build a “CSS Variables & Dark Mode Showcase” page
• Section 1: Define global color variables for text, backgrounds, and accents.
• Section 3: Experiment with clamp() for responsive text sizing.
• Section 4: Create an image gallery with aspect-ratio and object-fit.

Bonus Task:
• Add a frosted glass effect using backdrop-filter for a header or card.

🔸 8. Wrap-up + Q&A
• Learned how CSS variables simplify theme management.
• Practiced implementing dark mode with variables.
• Explored modern CSS features like clamp, aspect-ratio.
• Discussed accessibility and performance best practices.

🔸 Next Session Preview (Session 14)
• Floats, Shadows, and Filters.
• Using floats for layouts (and their limitations).
• Creating depth with box-shadows and text-shadows.
• Apply backdrop-filter for stylish overlays.
