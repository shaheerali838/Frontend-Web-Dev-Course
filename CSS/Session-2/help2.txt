🔸 1. Recap of Session 1
• What is CSS
• Three ways to apply CSS (inline, internal, external)
• CSS syntax: selector, property, value
• How to connect CSS to HTML
• Added basic background and font styles

🔸 2. CSS Selectors

• Element Selector – targets all elements of a given type (e.g., all paragraphs)
• Class Selector – targets elements with a specific class attribute
• ID Selector – targets a single element with a specific ID
• Group Selector – applies the same style to multiple selectors at once
• Universal Selector – targets all elements on the page
• Descendant Selector – targets an element inside another element

📝 Practice:
Use class and ID selectors to style two different elements differently. Combine selectors in a group for shared styles.

🔸 3. CSS Colors

• Color Keywords – like red, blue, green
• Hex Codes – like #ff0000
• RGB and RGBA – rgb(255, 0, 0), rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)
• HSL and HSLA – hsl(0, 100%, 50%), hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5)

📝 Practice:
Apply background and text colors using different color formats.
Try semi-transparent backgrounds using RGBA or HSLA.

🔸 4. CSS Units

• Absolute Units – px (pixels), pt (points), cm (centimeters), in (inches)
• Relative Units – %, em, rem, vw (viewport width), vh (viewport height)

📌 Tip:
Relative units like em and rem scale with the parent or root element and are better for responsiveness.

📝 Practice:
Set font sizes using both px and rem. Apply padding and margins using % and em.

🔸 5. Mini Project Task
Create a “Profile Card” using the following:
• A container styled using a class selector
• A heading and paragraph with different text colors
• Padding and margin using relative units
• Apply a background color using HEX or RGB
• Use at least two different types of selectors
