🔸 1. Recap of Session 9
• Learned what CSS units are and their role in styling
• Differentiated between absolute units (px, in, cm, mm, pt, pc) and relative units (%, em, rem, vw, vh, vmin, vmax)
• Practiced using rem for typography, % for fluid layouts, and vw/vh for viewport-based sizing
• Used calc() to combine units for precise spacing and layout control
• Built a responsive unit demo page showcasing various unit types

🔸 2. CSS Color Systems

Concepts to Cover:
• What color systems are and why multiple formats exist in CSS
• Hexadecimal colors (#RRGGBB and shorthand #RGB)
• RGB and RGBA – Red, Green, Blue (with optional Alpha for transparency)
• HSL and HSLA – Hue, Saturation, Lightness (with optional Alpha for transparency)
• Opacity property – affecting element and its children
• Choosing the right format for different use cases

Visual Explanation:
• How hex values work and the shorthand version (#fff for white)
• RGB scale from 0–255 for each color channel
• HSL values for intuitive color adjustments
• Difference between RGBA/HSLA transparency and the opacity property

🔸 3. Practical Applications of Color Formats

Key Points:
• Hex – compact and widely supported
• RGB/RGBA – best for fine-tuning color mixing and transparency
• HSL/HSLA – easier for adjusting lightness and saturation without changing hue
• Opacity – affects the whole element including text and child elements

Practice Idea:
• Create a color palette for a webpage using all four color formats
• Apply a semi-transparent background to a text box using RGBA or HSLA
• Use HSL to create multiple shades of the same base color

🔸 4. Tips & Common Mistakes

• Avoid setting opacity on a parent if only the background needs transparency — use RGBA/HSLA instead
• Use HSL for design systems where color adjustments are frequent
• Test colors on multiple devices for accurate appearance
• Maintain contrast for accessibility compliance

🔸 5. Practice Activity

Task: Build a “Color Showcase” page
• Display the same color in hex, RGB, and HSL formats
• Add an overlay effect on an image using semi-transparent background color

Bonus Task:
• Design a color theme switcher (light/dark mode) using CSS variables and color formats

🔸 6. Wrap-up + Q&A

Summary:
• Learned four main CSS color formats – Hex, RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA
• Understood when and why to use each format
• Practiced adding transparency with RGBA/HSLA and opacity
• Explored color adjustment techniques for modern UI design

🔸 Next Session Preview (Session 11):
• CSS Transitions & Animations – transition properties, easing functions, keyframes, animation control
• Adding movement and interactivity to web pages
• Creating smooth hover and page-load effects
• Use semi-transparent colors for overlays and hover effects
• Create hover effects using RGBA/HSLA transparency
