🔸 1. What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
It is used to control the visual presentation of HTML elements.
CSS defines how elements are displayed — including layout, color, spacing, fonts, backgrounds, and more.

🔸 2. Why Use CSS?
• Separates content (HTML) from design (CSS)
• Makes design changes easier and faster
• Enables consistency across all web pages
• Supports responsive design for different devices
• Improves user experience through styling

🔸 3. Ways to Apply CSS

• Inline CSS – added directly within an HTML element using the "style" attribute
• Internal CSS – placed inside a "style" tag within the "head" section of an HTML document
• External CSS – written in a separate file with a ".css" extension and linked to the HTML using the "link" tag

Each method has its use. Inline is quick but not reusable. Internal works for single-page styling. External is preferred for scalable, clean, and reusable code.

🔸 4. CSS Syntax (Concept Only)
Every CSS rule has three parts:
• Selector – the HTML element you want to style
• Property – the style you want to apply
• Value – the setting for that property

For example, if you want to change the color of all paragraphs to red:
• Selector: paragraph
• Property: color
• Value: red

🔸 5. CSS Comments
CSS comments are used to explain parts of your style rules.
They do not affect how the page looks.
You can also use comments to temporarily disable a line of CSS code while testing.

🔸 6. Connecting CSS to HTML
• Inline styles are written directly inside the HTML tag
• Internal styles go inside the head section of the HTML page using the style tag
• External styles are written in a separate file and connected using a link tag in the HTML head

External CSS is considered the best method for organizing styles in professional projects.

🔸 7. Practice Activity
Guide your viewers to:
• Add an inline style to a paragraph (e.g., change its text color)
• Use internal CSS to style a heading (e.g., change font or size)
• Create an external CSS file and apply background color and font family to the entire page

📝 Suggested Task for Learners:
Create a basic “Hello CSS” webpage and try applying all three types of CSS.
• Change the text color of a paragraph
• Set a background color for the body
This helps reinforce the structure and purpose of each CSS method.
