These affect how text looks but may not carry semantic meaning.

b – Bold (non-semantic)

i – Italic (non-semantic)

u – Underline (non-semantic)

mark – Highlights text

small – Decreases text size

🔹 3. Semantic Formatting Tags
Explain that these tags give meaning to content and are important for accessibility & SEO.

strong – Important text (renders bold)

em – Emphasized text (renders italic)

del – Deleted/struck text

ins – Inserted text (usually underlined)

sup – Superscript (e.g., x²)

sub – Subscript (e.g., H₂O)


🔹 4. HTML Comments
Syntax: <!-- This is a comment -->

Use case: Notes for developers, temporarily disabling code

🔹 5. White Space in HTML
Explain how HTML collapses multiple spaces/tabs/new lines into one space
Demonstrate how to create spacing:

Using multiple br tags (not best practice, but beginner-friendly)

Later mention CSS will handle layout professionally

🧠 Suggested Practice Task for Viewers:
Build an "About Me" section using:

h2 for the title

p for a paragraph about yourself

br to separate lines (temporarily)

hr to create a divider

Use strong, em, mark, sub, sup to format some personal or random info

Add a comment above the section like: “About Me Section Starts Here”

✅ Summary at End of Session:
You now know the difference between semantic and non-semantic tags

You can visually and meaningfully format web content

You understand how browsers interpret space and text structure

You’ve started building usable HTML blocks
